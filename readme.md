**:link: references**

- [Proofs](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/paul.goldberg/FCS/proofs.html)

**Definition:** The aim of a mathematical proof is to convince a (human) reader that the claim is true. Proofs are rarely “formal” in the sense of applying an agreed-upon set of rules for deducing one statement from another. Indeed, there are various levels of formality (or precision, or detail) that might be used in the presentation of a proof.

- [World Wide Web (WWW)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/World-Wide-Web)

**Definition:** The Web, as it's commonly known, is often confused with the internet. Although the two are intricately connected, they are different things. The internet is, as its name implies, a network -- a vast, global network that incorporates a multitude of lesser networks. As such, the internet consists of supporting infrastructure and other technologies. In contrast, the Web is a communications model that, through HTTP, enables the exchange of information over the internet.

- [What is a trie](https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/tree/trie/)

**Definition:** A trie is a tree-like data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet. By structuring the nodes in a particular way, words and strings can be retrieved from the structure by traversing down a branch path of the tree.

- [What is a Tree in Computer Science?](https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/trees-in-computer-science/)

**Definition:** A tree is an important data structure of computer science which is useful for storing hierarchically ordered data. Unlike stack, queue and linear lists (arrays and linked lists) which are used to store linear data like marks of students in a class, list of tasks to be done, etc, trees are used to store non-linear data structures in a hierarchical order. A family tree is the most common example of hierarchical data. Directory structure, corporate structure, etc are also common examples of hierarchical data.

- [What is Transport Layer Security (TLS)?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/)

**Definition:** Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP).

- [TCP/IP](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tcpip.htm)

**Definition:** Short for transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, TCP/IP is a set of rules (protocols) governing communications among all computers on the Internet. More specifically, TCP/IP dictates how information should be packaged (turned into bundles of information called packets), sent, and received, and how to get to its destination. TCP/IP was developed in 1978 and driven by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf.

</summary>
**:link: references**

- [Stack Data Structure](https://thecustomizewindows.com/2012/03/stack-data-structure-in-computer-science/)

**Definition:** Stack in practice includes limited set of objects. Elements can only be placed on top of the stack. Elements are stacked one above the other and in reverse order taken out from the stack . This is also known as Last-In-First-Out principle (LIFO). A common practical usage along with example will make the topic more clear. You probably have heard of Push and Pull. These Push and Pull actually are methods of heaping the data in an automated system. Push sets the object on top of the stack. Pop removes the top item from the stack. The action of pop is known as Pull.

### what is quick sort
<details>
<summary>
View Content
</summary>
**:link: references**

- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
- [tutorial point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.htm)

**Definition:** Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Efficient implementations of Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.

**Definition:** The sliding window technique places varying limits on the number of data packets that are sent before waiting for an acknowledgment signal back from the receiving computer. The number of data packets is called the window size. The limits on window size vary depending on the rate at which the receiving computer can process the data packets, and on the capacity of its buffer.

- [SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/SMTP-Simple-Mail-Transfer-Protocol)

**Definition:** SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail. However, since it is limited in its ability to queue messages at the receiving end, it is usually used with one of two other protocols, POP3 (Post Office Protocol) or IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), that let the user save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically from the server. In other words, users typically use a program that uses SMTP for sending e-mail and either POP3 or IMAP for receiving e-mail.

**Definition:** Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm for developing software using functions. Following the FP philosophy entails foregoing things like shared states, mutable data and side effects. Functional programming is a declarative paradigm because it relies on expressions and declarations rather than statements. Unlike procedures that depend on a local or global state, value outputs in FP depend only on the arguments passed to the function.
