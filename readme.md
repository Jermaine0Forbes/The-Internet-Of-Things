- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)
- [whatthefuck](https://whatthefuck.is/memoization)

**Definition:** In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

- [What is the Heap data structure](https://www.thecodingdelight.com/heap-data-structure/)

**Definition:** The heap is a binary tree, meaning at the most, each parent has two children. There are two types of heaps: the max and min heap. The root node of a max heap is the highest value in the heap, whereas a min heap has the minimum value allocated to the root node.

**Definition:** Agile is a process by which a team can manage a project by breaking it up into several stages and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage. The Agile methodology begins with clients describing how the end product will be used and what problem it will solve. This clarifies the customer's expectations to the project team.

- [Graph Traversal](http://btechsmartclass.com/data_structures/graph-traversal-dfs.html)

**Definition:** Graph traversal is a technique used for a searching vertex in a graph. The graph traversal is also used to decide the order of vertices is visited in the search process. A graph traversal finds the edges to be used in the search process without creating loops. That means using graph traversal we visit all the vertices of the graph without getting into looping path.

- [Functional Programming - What Is It and Why Does It Matter?](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/functional-programming)

**Definition:** Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm for developing software using functions. Following the FP philosophy entails foregoing things like shared states, mutable data and side effects. Functional programming is a declarative paradigm because it relies on expressions and declarations rather than statements. Unlike procedures that depend on a local or global state, value outputs in FP depend only on the arguments passed to the function.

- [double octopus](https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/protocol/simple-object-access-protocol/)

**Definition:** Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a client-server messaging protocol for exchanging structured data between web-services. SOAP uses XML for its message format and relies on standard application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

- [What is REST?](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)

**Definition:** REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web.

**Definition:** The algorithm efficiently visits and marks all the key nodes in a graph in an accurate breadthwise fashion. This algorithm selects a single node (initial or source point) in a graph and then visits all the nodes adjacent to the selected node. Remember, BFS accesses these nodes one by one.

- [Depth First Search Algorithm: What it is and How it Works](https://edgy.app/depth-first-search-algorithm-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)

**Definition:** Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any iteration.

**Definition 2:** a DFS algorithm traverses a tree or graph from the parent vertex down to its children and grandchildren vertices in a single path until it reaches a dead end.
