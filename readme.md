### Order
- [Big O Notation][big-o]
- depth first search
- breadth first search
- REST
- SOAP
- JWT
- OAuth
- Token Based authentication

### Data Structures
- iteration & recursion
- multidimesional arrays & matrices
- linked lists
- queues , stacks, and heaps
- sets & hash maps
- trees & binary search
- graph traversals, ex : depth first search, breath first search
- tries
- sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort)
- big o notation
- dynamic programming ( memoization, divide & conquer)
- proofs (contrapositive, contradiction, proof by cases, induction)
- multiple pointers
- sliding windows
- greedy algorithms

### DS Notes
- Most useful data structure is hashmaps
- learn about stacks & queues

### Top 10 algorithms
- depth first search
- breadth first search
- matching parenthesis
- hash tables
- variable/pointer manipulation
- reversing a linkedlist
- sorting algorithms fundamentals
- recursion
- custom data structures
- binary search
