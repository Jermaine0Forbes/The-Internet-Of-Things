- [Functional Programming - What Is It and Why Does It Matter?](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/functional-programming)

**Definition:** Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm for developing software using functions. Following the FP philosophy entails foregoing things like shared states, mutable data and side effects. Functional programming is a declarative paradigm because it relies on expressions and declarations rather than statements. Unlike procedures that depend on a local or global state, value outputs in FP depend only on the arguments passed to the function.

- [What is Dynamic Programming? Memoization and Tabulation](https://jarednielsen.com/dynamic-programming-memoization-tabulation/)

**Definition:**  is a technique of breaking down a problem into subproblems, solving these subproblems once, and storing their solutions.

- [Binary search](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search)

**Definition:** Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one

- [SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/SOAP-Simple-Object-Access-Protocol)
- [double octopus](https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/protocol/simple-object-access-protocol/)

**Definition:** Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a client-server messaging protocol for exchanging structured data between web-services. SOAP uses XML for its message format and relies on standard application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

- [What is REST?](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)

**Definition:** REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web.

- [Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm with EXAMPLE](https://www.guru99.com/breadth-first-search-bfs-graph-example.html)

**Definition:** The algorithm efficiently visits and marks all the key nodes in a graph in an accurate breadthwise fashion. This algorithm selects a single node (initial or source point) in a graph and then visits all the nodes adjacent to the selected node. Remember, BFS accesses these nodes one by one.

- [Depth First Search Algorithm: What it is and How it Works](https://edgy.app/depth-first-search-algorithm-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)

**Definition:** Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any iteration.

**Definition 2:** a DFS algorithm traverses a tree or graph from the parent vertex down to its children and grandchildren vertices in a single path until it reaches a dead end.
